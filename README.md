# Palkin-Designer-E-Commerce-Android-Application

Me and my cullices have created this android application as our internship project. We were assigned to create a dynamic android application for Palkin Designers. We have done it by creating two applications which we have named Upload App and Palkin App. Upload App is for merchant and Palkin App is for users.

# Upload App
This application is for merchant. We have connected this application with Firebase. It includes features such as insert data (images, price, description) and delete data. Merchant can also see the data inserted by him/her and he/she can also delete the data as per his/her requirements.

# Palkin App
This application is for users. We have connected this application with Firebase.It includes features such as splash screen, signup and login (authenticated with Firebase), view data inserted by merchant, remove account permanently.
